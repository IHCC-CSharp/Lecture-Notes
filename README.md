# Lecture Notes

[//]: # (TODO add screenshots of the completed examples for each lecture)

This repository holds in class examples and starting code for each lecture.
Some lectures include all the notes some are just a starting point (some HTML and images).
Often in class I will ask you to get some code from here and use it during our lecture.

If you do fork this repository, make sure you keep your fork up to date.

> This repository is always under construction. So make sure to keep your local copy up to date.

## How to Keep Up to Date

In your terminal run this command to pull the latest changes from this repository.
This will overwrite any changes you have made locally.
So how to keep your own notes and my notes on your computer is up to you.
You might want to keep them in separate folders.

```bash
git pull origin main
```
