## Math

Not much to cover here. We will see in the example C# math is very similar to
Java.

## Comments

Just like Java, C# supports both single-line and multi-line comments.

```csharp
// This is a single-line comment

/*
This is a multi-line comment
*/
```

## Top Level Statements

C# 9 introduced top-level statements, allowing you to write code without
explicitly defining a class or Main method. This is great for beginners and
small programs.

> We will be using top-level statements **all** our examples

## Example

Go Look at the example code in the Playground folder. We will go through it in
class.
